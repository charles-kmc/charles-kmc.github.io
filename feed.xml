This mismatch can arise due to variations in factors such as lighting conditions, sensor noise, data collection methods, or demographic differences. As a result, models trained on the source domain may struggle to generalize effectively to the target domain, leading to degraded performance.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Inbalance data</strong>: Imbalanced data occur when some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, Leading to bias model performance. Specifically, machine learning models tend to focus on the majority calss, as it dominates the training data while under representing or misclassifying the minority class. This problem can severely impact model generalisation, prcticulary in application such as anomaly detection and medical diagnosis.</p> </li> </ul> ]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="generative-models"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction In this post, I will work you through some technical tools to effectively prepare a succesful Machine learning interview role!]]></summary></entry></feed>

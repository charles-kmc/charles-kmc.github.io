In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Mathemitics from the [Universy of Dschang](https://www.univ-dschang.org/) where my work focused on modelling, analyzing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I completed another master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [African Masters of Machine intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Statistics and machine learning at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors `Marcelo Pereyra` and `Jean-Fran√ßois Giovannelli`. During my doctoral studies, my work focused on developing advanced methodologies integrating statistical modelling with deep learning in a unified framework to address inverse problems in imaging.

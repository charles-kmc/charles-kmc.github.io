In 2024, I obtained my doctoral degree in computational imaging at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh - under the supervision of Professor `Marcelo Pereyra` and Professor `Jean-François Giovannelli`. In 2020, I obtained a master's degree in artificial intelligence from the African Masters of Machine intelligence (AMMI) in Rwanda, where I worked on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. I also held a master degree in Applied mathemitics from the Universy of Dschang in 2015, where my work focused on modelling, analysing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. 

My research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors to solve challenging problems in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical methods with machine learning approaches, aiming to improve the precision and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis. My PhD research, supervised by Professor `Marcelo Pereyra` and Professor `Jean-François Giovannelli`, centered around the Bayesian methods for image inverse problems.

<!-- I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in computational imaging, Bayesian methods, or related interdisciplinary fields, where I can further contribute to advancements in imaging science, signal processing, or applied mathematics. -->

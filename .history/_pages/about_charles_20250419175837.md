In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Mathemitics from the Universy of Dschang where my work focused on modelling, analyzing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I completed third master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the African Masters of Machine intelligence (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Statistics and machine learning at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors `Marcelo Pereyra` and `Jean-Fran√ßois Giovannelli`. During my doctoral studies, my work focused on developing advanced methodologies integrating statistical modelling with deep learning in a unified framework to address inverse problems in imaging.

Curently, my research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors to solve challenging problems in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical methods with machine learning approaches, aiming to improve the precision and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis.

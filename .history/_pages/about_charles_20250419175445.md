<!-- I am a Research Associate at `Heriot-Watt University` in Edinburgh, UK. My research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors, with a primary application in computational imaging. -->
In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Mathemitics from the Universy of Dschang where my work focused on modelling, analyzing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I completed third master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the African Masters of Machine intelligence (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Statistics and machine learning at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors `Marcelo Pereyra` and `Jean-François Giovannelli`. During my doctoral studies, my work focused on developing advanced methodologie

Curently, my research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors to solve challenging problems in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical methods with machine learning approaches, aiming to improve the precision and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis. 

<!-- I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in computational imaging, Bayesian methods, or related interdisciplinary fields, where I can further contribute to advancements in imaging science, signal processing, or applied mathematics. -->

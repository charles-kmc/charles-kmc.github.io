In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Mathemitics from the Universy of Dschang where my work focused on modelling, analyzing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I completed third master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [African Masters of Machine intelligence]() (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Statistics and machine learning at Heriot-Watt University] in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors `Marcelo Pereyra` and `Jean-Fran√ßois Giovannelli`. During my doctoral studies, my work focused on developing advanced methodologies integrating statistical modelling with deep learning in a unified framework to address inverse problems in imaging.

Currently, my research centers on Bayesian inverse problems, with a particular emphasis on leveraging data-driven priors to tackle complex challenges in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical techniques and machine learning approaches, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis.

<!-- I am a Research Associate at `Heriot-Watt University` in Edinburgh, UK. My research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors, with a primary application in computational imaging. -->
In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied mathemitics from the Universy of Dschang in 2015, where my work focused on modelling, analysing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I obtained a master's degree in artificial intelligence from the African Masters of Machine intelligence (AMMI) in Rwanda, where I worked on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. After my masters degree, I obtained my doctoral degree in computational imaging at the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh - under the supervision of Professor `Marcelo Pereyra` and Professor `Jean-François Giovannelli`. 

Curently, my research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors to solve challenging problems in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical methods with machine learning approaches, aiming to improve the precision and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis. 

<!-- I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in computational imaging, Bayesian methods, or related interdisciplinary fields, where I can further contribute to advancements in imaging science, signal processing, or applied mathematics. -->

n 2015, I earned a Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Dschang, where my research focused on modeling, analyzing, and simulating the life cycle of Plutella xylostella. In 2020, I completed a second Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence at the African Masters of Machine Intelligence (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Computational Imaging at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors Marcelo Pereyra and Jean-François Giovannelli.

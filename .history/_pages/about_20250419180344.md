In 2015, I obtained a master's degree in Applied Mathemitics from the [Universy of Dschang](https://www.univ-dschang.org/) where my work focused on modelling, analyzing and smulating life cycle of Pultella Xylostella. In 2020, I completed another master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the [African Masters of Machine intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) in Rwanda, working on semi-blind inverse problems in imaging. Following this, I pursued a PhD in Statistics and machine learning at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/) in Edinburgh, under the supervision of Professors `Marcelo Pereyra` and `Jean-François Giovannelli`. During my doctoral studies, my work focused on developing advanced methodologies integrating statistical modelling with deep learning in a unified framework to address inverse problems in imaging.

Currently, my research centers on Bayesian inverse problems, with a particular emphasis on leveraging data-driven priors to tackle complex challenges in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical techniques and machine learning approaches, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis.

I am a Research Associate at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/), Edinburgh, UK, where my research focuses on Bayesian inverse problems, particularly leveraging data-driven priors to solve challenging problems in computational imaging. My work bridges advanced statistical methods with machine learning approaches, aiming to improve the precision and efficiency of image reconstruction and analysis. My PhD research, supervised by Professor [Marcelo Pereyra](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/marcelo-a-pereyra) and Professor [Jean-François Giovannelli](http://giovannelli.free.fr/), centered around the Bayesian methods for image inverse problems.

<!-- I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities in computational imaging, Bayesian methods, or related interdisciplinary fields, where I can further contribute to advancements in imaging science, signal processing, or applied mathematics. -->

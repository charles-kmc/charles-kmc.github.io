- **Domain shifts**:Domain shifts occur when the statistical distribution of data differs between the training (source domain) and real-world deployment (target domain). This mismatch degrades model performance in new environments.
- **Inbalance data**: Imbalanced data occur when some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, Leading to bias model performance. Specifically, machine learning models tend to focus on the majority calss, as it dominates the training data while under representing or misclassifying the minority class. This problem can sever 

Imbalanced data occurs when certain classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, leading to biased model performance. In such scenarios, machine learning models tend to focus on the majority class, as it dominates the training data, while underrepresenting or misclassifying the minority class. This imbalance can severely impact model generalization, particularly in applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection, where minority class instances are often the most critical. Addressing this issue requires specialized techniques, including data resampling (oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class), cost-sensitive learning, or algorithmic adjustments such as class-weighted loss functions to ensure fair representation and improved predictive performance.

<h3> Introduction </h3>
In this post, I will work you through some technical tools to effectively prepare a succesful Machine learning interview role!

<h3> Computer Vison </h3>
Challenges in computer vison

- **Domain shifts**: Domain shifts occur when there is a discrepancy between the statistical distribution of data in the training environment (source domain) and the real-world deployment setting (target domain). This mismatch can arise due to variations in factors such as lighting conditions, sensor noise, data collection methods, or demographic differences. As a result, models trained on the source domain may struggle to generalize effectively to the target domain, leading to degraded performance.

- **Inbalance data**: Imbalanced data occur when some classes have significantly fewer samples compared to others, Leading to bias model performance. Specifically, machine learning models tend to focus on the majority calss, as it dominates the training data while under representing or misclassifying the minority class. This problem can severely impact model generalisation, prcticulary in application such as anomaly detection and medical diagnosis.

<h2>Definitions</h2>

- **Bias**: Bias is a systematic error in a machine learning model that causes it to produce results
- **Variance**: Variance is a measure of how much a model's predictions vary when given
- **Overfitting**: Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training
- **Underfitting**: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to capture
- **Regularization**: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best

This mismatch can arise due to variations in factors such as lighting conditions, sensor noise, data collection methods, or demographic differences. As a result, models trained on the source domain may struggle to generalize effectively to the target domain, leading to degraded performance. Addressing domain shifts often involves techniques such as domain adaptation, domain generalization, or self-supervised learning to enhance model robustness across different environments.
